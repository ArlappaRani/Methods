Method Overloading:
Creating  a multiple methods having same methodNames inside the same class

MaggiProgram:
In this program creating a multiple methods having a same name and 
inside the same class
In each method will perform a different tasks
In that first we are not taking any parameters,will not pass arguments
In that second task is taking a quantity parameter and passing arguments 
to method
In that third task is taking a Type parameter which return string value
In that fourth task is taking a two inputs quantity and type of maggi 
These 4 tasks performing with a same method name
Finally creating main method and calling the methods


Calculate Area:
In this program calculating the area of square,circle,rectangle
For calculating area of square we want side value it will be calculated
as (side*side) So we taking user input as side
For calculating area of circle formula is (3.14F*radius*radius)So will
take user input as radius it is float type
For calculating area of Rectangle formula is(Length*breadth)So will take
Length,breadth two user inputs
We storing results in a variable and displaying results
These all things are written in a main method
Here we are taking same method names inside the same class
creating a methods and returning the values
